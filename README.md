# Handball analysis

This repository contains notebooks used for handball ranking [[1]](#references) and handball predictions [[2]](#references).


## Structure

The following notebooks are available as empirical illustration of the differents papers in the [References](#references)

* [DistributionAnalysis.ipynb](/DistributionAnalysis.ipynb): refered in [[1]](#references) and illustrate the need of a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution.
* [StrengthRanking.ipynb](/StrengthRanking.ipynb): referred in [[1]](#references) to illustrate the ranking of European female teams using the proposed strength metric.
* [CMPanalysis.ipynb](/CMPanalysis.ipynb): referred in [[1]](#references) to justify the need of the log relation between the parameters and the strength (empirical mean).


## Requirements

⚠️ The presented notebooks may use libraries (such as `handballPredictions`) that are not publicly available.
Individual request can be evaluated to grant access to these libraries.
